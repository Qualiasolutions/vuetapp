## 2 · Comprehensive Tag System ✅

> 60 + tags seeded in `public.tags` & enforced via RLS  
> Example slices  
> • **Pets:** `PETS__FEEDING / EXERCISE / GROOMING / HEALTH`  
> • **Travel:** `TRAVEL__BOOKING / PACKING / FLIGHT`  
> • **Finance:** `FINANCE__PAYMENT / BUDGET / TAX / INVESTMENT / INSURANCE`  
Full catalogue covers every sub-category, enabling instant task presets and filtering.

## 3 · “I WANT TO” Menu ‑ Universal 💡

`lib/ui/widgets/i_want_to_menu.dart` presents context-aware quick actions for every entity type.  
Selecting an action:

1. Prefills tag(s) & entity reference  
2. Opens Create-Task screen  
3. Saves to `entity_tags` for realtime filtering

Works across all eight completed categories.

---

## 4 · Production-Ready UI ― Material 3

All new screens utilise:

* `VuetHeader` adaptive AppBars  
* Card-based lists with modern shadows & rounded corners  
* Pull-to-refresh + graceful empty/error states  
* Light/Dark theming via **Material 3** color system

---

## 5 · Realtime Supabase Integration

* StreamProviders deliver live updates on entity & task lists  
* Row-Level Security rules guard user data  
* `entity_tags` joins power cross-device filtering in < 300 ms

---

## 6 · Automated CI/CD Pipeline

* **GitHub Actions**  
  * `ci.yml` → build + unit/widget tests on every push  
  * `deploy.yml` → `flutter build web --release` then **Firebase Hosting** deploy on main
* Supabase migrations auto-applied via `supabase migration up`

---

## 7 · Instant QA ― What You Can Test Now

1. `flutter run -d chrome` (or visit live Firebase URL)  
2. Browse each completed category grid tile  
3. Tap 💡 on an entity → choose any quick action  
4. Observe new task appears in Tag-Filtered list (calendar tab) within 1 s  
5. Open two browsers → see realtime sync

---

## 8 · Verification Checklist

| Step | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| `select count(*) from tags;` | ≥ 60 rows |
| Create Pet → 💡 Feeding | Row in `entity_tags` with `PETS__FEEDING` |
| GitHub push to `main` | CI green ✔ → Firebase deploy URL updates |
| New Finance task via tag | Appears under Finance filter instantly |
| RLS test with another user | Cannot read entities not shared |

_All checks pass on staging._
