Category Image Assets

This directory contains background images for the main category grid displayed on the home screen.

Required images for full implementation:
- home.png (Home & Garden)
- pets.png (Pets)
- social.png (Social & Interests)
- education.png (Education & Career)
- travel.png (Travel)
- health.png (Health & Beauty)
- finance.png (Finance) 
- transport.png (Transport)
- charity.png (Charity and Religion)

All category images have been copied from the original React app (react-old-vuet/old-frontend/assets/images/categories/) and are now available for use. The "References" category has been changed to "Charity and Religion" with the corresponding image renamed from family.png to charity.png.

For optimal display, images should:
- Have a 3:4 aspect ratio (width:height)
- Be at least 300x400px in resolution
- Have sufficient contrast to allow white text overlay
- Use imagery that clearly represents the category concept
