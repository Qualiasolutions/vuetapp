For someone remaking this app completely in Flutter with Supabase, there are some additional important considerations beyond the categories, entities, and tasks structure:
Key Considerations for Flutter/Supabase Remake
1. Database Schema Design in Supabase
RLS (Row Level Security): Implement proper RLS policies in Supabase for entity and task ownership/access. This is critical for the multi-user sharing functionality.
Polymorphic Relationships: Django's polymorphic models don't directly translate to PostgreSQL. You'll need to implement polymorphism using either:
Single table inheritance (one entities table with a type column)
Table per type (separate tables with foreign key relationships)
Type-specific JSON fields for entity-specific data
Many-to-Many Relationships: Carefully design junction tables for memberships, task-entity relationships, etc.
2. Real-time Features
Supabase Realtime: Leverage Supabase's real-time subscriptions for collaborative features:
Task updates between family members
Entity sharing
Calendar synchronization
Push Notifications: The original app uses notifications for reminders - implement using Firebase Cloud Messaging or a similar service.
3. Authentication and User Management
Family Sharing: The original app has complex family account relationships. Implement custom logic on top of Supabase Auth.
Role-based Permissions: Tasks and entities have different permission levels which needs careful implementation.
4. Calendar Implementation
Calendar Algorithms: The scheduling engine for flexible tasks is quite sophisticated. Consider how to implement this logic:
Use Supabase Edge Functions for complex scheduling
Or implement the scheduling logic in the Flutter app
Recurrence Rules: The recurrence system is complex with many patterns and exceptions.
5. Offline Functionality
Offline-First Architecture: The original app likely assumes constant connectivity. For mobile, implement:
Local storage with SQLite or Hive
Conflict resolution for offline changes
Sync strategies when connection is restored
6. Migration Strategy
Data Migration: Consider how existing users will migrate their data.
Feature Parity Planning: Implement critical features first, then nice-to-haves.
7. Performance Considerations
Data Loading Patterns: Implement efficient loading strategies:
Pagination for large entity/task lists
Smart caching for frequently accessed data
Optimistic UI updates
Large Family Accounts: Test with large datasets for families with many entities and tasks.
8. Premium Features
Subscription Management: The original app has premium features. Implement:
In-app purchases integration
Feature gating logic
Family sharing of premium features
9. External Integrations
Calendar Sync: Support for external calendar integrations (Google, Apple, etc.).
Contact Integration: The app has contact features that should integrate with device contacts.
10. Flutter-Specific Architecture
State Management: Choose appropriate state management for complex entity-task relationships (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc.).
Code Organization: Consider feature-first architecture to manage the complexity.
UI Component System: Build a consistent design system to maintain the many different entity and task types.
11. Testing Strategy
Database Migrations: Test schema evolution as features develop.
Multi-user Scenarios: Test family sharing edge cases.
Scheduling Engine: Thoroughly test the task scheduling algorithms.
These considerations, combined with your understanding of the entity-task relationships, should give you a solid foundation for rebuilding the app in Flutter with Supabase while avoiding major architectural issues down the road.
