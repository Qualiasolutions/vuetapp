## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY QUEUE

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Weeks 1-4) - **CRITICAL**
1. **Entity Management System**: Implement all 15+ entity types, ensuring strict alignment with `memory-bank/Categories-Entities-Tasks-Connection/` documentation for models, fields, and relationships.
2. **Entity-Task Integration**: Link entities to tasks properly
3. **Entity CRUD Operations**: Full entity management capabilities

### PHASE 2: CORE FEATURES (Weeks 5-8) - **ESSENTIAL**  
1. **Advanced Task System**: FlexibleTask, FixedTask, recurrence
2. **Family Collaboration**: Invitations, sharing, permissions
3. **Calendar Integration**: Basic calendar with task integration

### PHASE 3: ADVANCED FEATURES (Weeks 9-12) - **IMPORTANT**
1. **Routines System**: Complete routine management
2. **Timeblocks System**: Visual time management
3. **External Integrations**: iCal sync, notifications

### PHASE 4: ENHANCEMENT (Weeks 13-16) - **NICE-TO-HAVE**
1. **School Terms**: Academic planning features
2. **Advanced Notifications**: Push notification system
3. **Help System**: In-app documentation

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Current Status
- **Features Implemented**: ~25% of React app
- **Core Functionality**: Missing entity system (80% of app value)
- **User Experience**: Good foundation, missing substance
- **Data Architecture**: Basic models, some complex relationships. Addressed critical column name mismatches between Dart models and Supabase schema for `entities` and `entity_categories` tables.

### Target Status (100% Parity)
- **Features Implemented**: 100% of React app features
- **Core Functionality**: Complete entity management system
- **User Experience**: Superior to React app (Flutter advantages)
- **Data Architecture**: Complete Supabase schema matching Django

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Entity System First**: Nothing works properly without entities. Recent fixes for DB schema mismatches are a step towards this.
2. **React App as Specification**: Exact feature replication required
3. **Phase-based Implementation**: Don't skip to enhancements
4. **Family Features**: Multi-user functionality is essential

## CURRENT BLOCKING ISSUES

### 1. **Entity System Foundational Issues Addressed, Implementation Still Needed** - CRITICAL BLOCKER
- **Database schema mismatches (e.g., `entities.category_id`, `entity_categories.createdAt`) have been addressed by refactoring Dart models and data access layers to use correct column names (`app_category_id`) and types, along with `@JsonKey` annotations.** This should unblock basic entity CRUD operations that were failing due to these specific SQL errors.
- However, the full Entity Management System (15+ entity types, specialized forms, entity-task integration) is still largely unimplemented (remains at ~0-5% actual feature completeness).
- All categories are essentially empty without entities being created and listed correctly.
- Task-entity integration is fundamental to the app and remains missing.

### 2. **Task Scheduling Primitive** - MAJOR BLOCKER  
- Current task system is too basic for real productivity use
- Missing flexible vs fixed task distinction
- No advanced recurrence or scheduling intelligence

### 3. **No Family Collaboration** - MAJOR BLOCKER
- App is designed for family use but has no family features
- Single-user experience only
- Missing core value proposition

## NEXT STEPS FOR ANY AGENT

1. **START WITH ENTITIES**: Begin implementing the entity management system, ensuring it aligns with the specifications in `memory-bank/Categories-Entities-Tasks-Connection/`.
2. **USE REACT AS SPEC**: Reference React app for exact behavior
3. **MODEL-FIRST APPROACH**: Implement Supabase tables matching Django models
4. **NO NEW FEATURES**: Focus on parity before enhancements

The React app in `react-old-vuet/` is the complete specification. The Flutter app is currently a basic shell with ~25% of the required functionality.
