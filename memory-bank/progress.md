  dueDate: DateTime(2025, 6, 10),
  scheduledStartTime: null, // Auto-scheduled by system
  isScheduled: false, // Will be true once scheduled
)
```

```dart
FixedTask(
  startDateTime: DateTime(2025, 6, 5, 14, 0),
  endDateTime: DateTime(2025, 6, 5, 15, 30),
  startTimezone: 'America/New_York',
  duration: 90, // Calculated automatically
)
```

### **Advanced Recurrence Patterns**
- **Daily**: Every day or every N days
- **Weekdaily**: Monday through Friday only
- **Weekly**: Specific days of the week
- **Monthly**: Same date each month or specific weekday
