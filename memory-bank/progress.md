## Next Session Priorities
1.  **Testing Current Changes (User Task)**: 
    *   Test GoRouter setup (now applied to all main files) by running the app and navigating within Pets category and other GoRouter-integrated routes.
    *   Test automatic task generation for Pet vaccinations by creating/updating Pets with `vaccinationDue` dates and checking for task creation.
    *   Review UI refinements for Pets category.
2.  **"Social Interests" Category - Testing (User Task)**:
    *   Test CRUD operations and navigation for Hobbies, Social Plans, and Events.
3.  **GoRouter Refactor (Production & Main)**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED.
4.  **Populate `parent_id` Data (User Task)**: User to update `parent_id` values in the `entity_categories` table in Supabase to define actual category hierarchies.
5.  **Proceed with Next Entity Category Implementation**: After "Social Interests" Phase 1 is tested, identify and implement the next highest priority entity category (e.g., Education).
6.  **Update Memory Bank**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED for this session.

## Blockers & Decisions Needed
- (Resolved in this session) ~~FAMILY Category: How to handle missing FAMILY category in backend?~~
- (Resolved in this session) ~~Extra Categories: Keep 14 categories or reduce to 13 per guides?~~
- (Resolved) ~~**Integer Category IDs**: Confirm approach for mapping new UUID-based categories to legacy integer IDs if still required by parts of the system (e.g., `entitiesByCategoryProvider`). The plan is to add an integer ID column to `entity_categories`.~~ (This has been implemented by adding `app_category_int_id`).
- **Migration Strategy**: Gradual refactor vs. complete rebuild? (Ongoing consideration)

*This progress tracking will be updated each session to maintain continuity across task handoffs.*
