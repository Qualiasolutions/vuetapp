# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists - FLUTTER REPLICA OF REACT APP
**CRITICAL**: This is NOT a new application. This is a migration/replica project to recreate the exact functionality of the React Native app (`react-old-vuet`) using Flutter + Supabase instead of React Native + Django.

**Primary Goal**: Create a literal replica with 100% feature parity, then enhance with:
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Modern Flutter UI with improved navigation
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: LANA AI for intelligent task and entity management (ENHANCEMENT, not replacement)
- **Seamless Integration**: Cross-feature data flow and analytics
- **Family Collaboration**: Shared entities, tasks, and planning capabilities (EXISTING FEATURE to replicate)

## Problems It Solves

### Personal Productivity Management
- **Task Organization**: Lists, routines, and timeblock scheduling
- **Entity Management**: Comprehensive tracking of personal/professional entities across 15+ categories
- **Calendar Integration**: Unified view of tasks, routines, and external calendar events
- **AI Assistance**: Natural language task creation and management

### Family Coordination
- **Shared Planning**: Family members can collaborate on tasks, events, and entities
- **Permission Management**: Role-based access to family resources
- **Communication**: Messaging system for family coordination
- **Invitation System**: Easy family member onboarding

### Category-Based Organization
- **Career**: Professional goals, employees, days off
- **Education**: Academic plans, schools, terms, extracurriculars
- **Finance**: Financial tracking and planning
- **Food**: Meal planning and food management
- **Garden**: Garden planning and maintenance
- **Health**: Health goals, appointments, patient management
- **Home**: Home appliances and maintenance
- **Laundry**: Laundry planning and scheduling
- **Lists**: Comprehensive list management (shopping, planning, etc.)
- **Pets**: Complete pet ecosystem (vets, walkers, groomers, insurance)
- **Social**: Events, holidays, anniversaries, guest lists
- **Transport**: Vehicle management (cars, boats, public transport)
- **Travel**: Trip planning and travel bookings

## How It Should Work

### Core User Flow
1. **Setup & Onboarding**: Guided setup with category completion tracking

- **Unified Calendar**: All time-based activities in one view
- **Cross-Feature Analytics**: Insights across all productivity areas

## User Experience Goals

### Immediate Improvements Over React Version

- **Better Navigation**: Streamlined navigation with clear information hierarchy
- **Enhanced Integration**: Features work together seamlessly
- **AI Enhancement**: Intelligent assistance throughout the app

### Long-term Vision
- **Comprehensive Life Management**: Single app for all personal/family organization
- **Intelligent Automation**: AI learns patterns and suggests optimizations
- **Seamless Collaboration**: Effortless family coordination and communication
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports growing families and complex needs

## Success Metrics
- **Feature Completeness**: 100% parity with React version + AI enhancements
