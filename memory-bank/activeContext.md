# Active Context - Vuet Flutter Migration
*Last Updated: January 7, 2025*

## Current Session Focus
**Primary Objective**: Initialize Memory Bank and assess current Flutter app state vs. target architecture from guides

## Backend Analysis Results
**Database Status**: ✅ Comprehensive Supabase schema discovered
- **Categories**: 14 implemented (vs 13 in guides) - includes extra "Charity & Religion" and "Documents"
- **Entity System**: Full polymorphic system with 50+ entity types
- **Tables**: 80+ tables including tasks, families, calendar, lists, routines, etc.
- **Missing**: FAMILY category from guides (but family system exists in separate tables)

## Key Findings
1. **Architecture Gap**: Current Flutter app uses hardcoded categories vs. schema-driven approach in guides
2. **Color Palette**: Current theme doesn't match Modern Palette (Dark Jungle Green, Medium Turquoise, Orange, Steel, White)
3. **Widget Library**: Missing modern components (VuetHeader, VuetTextField, VuetDatePicker)
4. **Auto-Task System**: Backend has task automation but Flutter app may not leverage it fully

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Update theme_config.dart** with Modern Palette colors
2. **Create modern widget library** matching guide specifications
3. **Implement schema-driven category system** to match backend
4. **Add FAMILY category** or map existing family tables to category system

## Backend Entity Categories Discovered
| ID | Category | Group | Status |
|----|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Pets | Pets | ✅ Matches guides |
| 2 | Social Interests | Social & Interests | ✅ Matches guides |
| 3 | Education | Education & Career | ✅ Matches guides |
| 4 | Career | Education & Career | ✅ Matches guides |
| 5 | Travel | Travel | ✅ Matches guides |
| 6 | Health & Beauty | Health & Beauty | ✅ Matches guides |
| 7 | Home | Home & Essentials | ✅ Matches guides |
| 8 | Garden | Home & Essentials | ✅ Matches guides |
| 9 | Food | Home & Essentials | ✅ Matches guides |
| 10 | Laundry | Home & Essentials | ✅ Matches guides |
| 11 | Finance | Finance | ✅ Matches guides |
| 12 | Transport | Transport | ✅ Matches guides |
| 13 | Charity & Religion | Charity & Religion | ⚠️ Extra category |
| 14 | Documents | Home & Essentials | ⚠️ Extra category |
| - | **FAMILY** | - | ❌ Missing from categories |

## Critical Decisions Needed
1. **FAMILY Category**: Add as category #15 or map existing family tables?
2. **Extra Categories**: Keep Charity & Religion + Documents or align with 13-category system?
3. **Migration Strategy**: Gradual refactor vs. complete rebuild of category system?

## Backend Capabilities Confirmed
- ✅ Full entity polymorphic system with 50+ types
- ✅ Task automation and recurrence system
- ✅ Family/group sharing system
- ✅ Calendar integration with external calendars
- ✅ List management with templates and categories
- ✅ Professional categories for business users
- ✅ Reference groups and tagging system
- ✅ Comprehensive user profiles and permissions

## Flutter App Assessment Status
- ✅ Backend analysis complete
- ⏳ Frontend architecture assessment pending
- ⏳ Gap analysis between current and target state pending
- ⏳ Implementation roadmap pending

## Context for Next Session
Continue with Flutter app architecture assessment and begin implementing Modern Palette theme updates as the foundation for alignment with memory bank guides.
